# DS_Cpp
Data Strctures libraries for C++/C.
The libraries can be easily translated to C, since just a tiny few of C++ specific functions were used.
Everything was made from scratch, I take full credits.

The first one covers both Singly and Doubly Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues and Binary Search Trees.
The second one covers Priority Queues, AVL Trees and Braphs.

The data contained within these structures is implemented as int.
It can be changed, but then the functions implementation must be changed accordignly.

If you have any extra function that can be added to these, please be welcome to provide,
as I constantly check the Pull Requeusts.
